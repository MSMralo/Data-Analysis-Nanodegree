## Summary

This story is about a data set containing 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right or left handed), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs. 
**for making a visualization that shows differences among the performance of the baseball players**

## Design

After collecting feedback from people on Facebook, I focused on making each slide to carry exactly one message to the viewer to make each point more concise.

As part of design process, visualizations were created to answer below questions
1) what percent hit with left hand?  ? Created a Pie chart showing the % distribution
2) How handedness affect batting stats in baseball ? Created a Line chart to study the relationship
3) Does player size account for home run differences across handedness groups ? created a bar plot between the average player weight and Number of home runs




## Feedback

Questions are collected from readers with small or no data analysis background against across story versions.

version 1:
-circles chart doesn't show the relation between each of the other elements
-add more details to the chart as it shows as empty


version 2
-you better use more dimensions rather than only the percentage of handedness
-make comparison on different measurement for better telling about the data you use
